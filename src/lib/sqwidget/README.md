# Sqwidget

Sqwidget is a framework for adding components to a page in a way that ensures
they are self contained and namespaced.

## Scaffold

Installing sqwidget via bower will add a 'sqwidget' scaffold to your grunt
config. You can start a new widget by typing the following inside a new project
directory:

`grunt-init sqwidget`

This will provide a simple sqwidget bundle for you to fill out.

## Development

```
npm install grunt-cli -g
npm install bower -g
bower install
npm install
grunt test

```
